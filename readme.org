#+title: Quoridor

* Goal
This project tries to implement the abstract strategic board-game /Quoridor/ as a web-version.
There are already a range of implementation.
As a learning exercise we will try to build it from scratch.
But we can take advantage of the existing solutions and try to combine the best UI-elements.
So far I have not seen an online multiplayer version (well except for some proprietary websites).
With our lessons from /HiveMind/ we should be able to quickly adapt a similar system.
We have to make sure that the player agents are as abstract as possible in order that we can implement a wide array of agents such as
- Na√Øve player
- Monte-Carlo tree search
  alpha-beta pruning

* Abstractions
- board size
- wall numbers
- pawn numbers

* UI
- Placing walls
- the board
